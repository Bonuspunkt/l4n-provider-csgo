const publicComp = `## Classic: Competitive
This is the classic gameplay that made Counter-Strike famous.
Queue up and join a 5v5 best-of-30 match using standard competitive Counter-Strike rules on one of the classic maps.
You can join a match on your own, or form a team and enter a match as a unit.`;
const publicCasual = `## Classic: Casual
Ready to play some Counter-Strike, but don't want to commit to a full match?
Find a casual match and play at your own pace.
In Casual mode, players automatically receive body armor and defusal kits and gain bonus rewards for kills.`;
const publicDemo = `## Demolition
In demolition mode, players take turns attacking and defending a single bombsite in a series of maps designed for fast-paced gameplay.
Players are automatically granted a starting weapon, and advance through a sequence of firearms when they register a kill.
If youâ€™re up to the challenge, you can try to register a kill each round and reach the ultimate weapons, powerful sniper rifles!`;
const publicGungame = `## Arms Race
Arms race is a gun-progression mode featuring instant respawning and a ton of close-quarter combat.
Players gain new weapons immediately after registering a kill as they work their way through each weapon in the game.
Get a kill with the final weapon, a golden knife, and win the match.`;
